# HP protein with SRD solvent

srd_box has a python script to put the HP protein from Jewett & Shea PNAS 2004 in a SRD solvent,
    all in a periodic box.
    The LAMMPS script works with 2014 and newer versions of LAMMPS.

srd_cyl puts the same protein in a cylinder.  LAMMPS needs to be recompiled with these 
    new fix_srd files.  These fix_srd files will only work for a cylindrical geometry.
